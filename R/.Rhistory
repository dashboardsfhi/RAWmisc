This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(ggvis)
mtcars %>% ggvis(x = ~wt, y = ~mpg) %>% layer_points()
```
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mtcars %>%
ggvis(~wt, ~mpg) %>%
layer_smooths(span = input_slider(0.5, 1, value = 1)) %>%
layer_points(size := input_slider(100, 1000, value = 100))
